"""The motion state machine — one MIT frame per tick, never a blocking call.

Every state's ``tick`` sends at most one frame and returns, so the worker's loop
stays interruptible: an E-stop, a new slider target or a fault is noticed within
one 5 ms tick.  That property is the whole reason the console drives the motor
through ``send_mit_frame`` instead of any SDK convenience method, all of which
block inside ``control_mit_stream`` with no abort hook.

Force semantics
---------------
A force setpoint is a torque feed-forward, and two things make it mean what it
says.

**The frame carries no gains at all.**  ``kp=0`` and ``kd=0``, so the only
torque in it is the feed-forward.  A MIT gain is a torque that depends on
something other than the setpoint — ``kp`` on how far the jaws have sunk into
the object, ``kd`` on how fast the drive believes they are moving — and either
one makes the delivered force differ from the number on the screen.  Measured
against a 500 Nm/rad object, a 40 N setpoint at ``kp=150`` landed at 31 N and
would run *over* the setpoint against a stiffer one, and a setpoint whose object
yields under load sags as it yields.  With no gain the grip force equals the
setpoint, which is what makes the 40 N rating a real bound rather than an
aspiration.  The SDK reached the same place from the other side, in its #29:
``hold_kp``/``hold_kd`` are deprecated there and a held force is the
feed-forward alone.

**The reference freezes at contact.**  ``q`` is still sent — a drive wants a
position in every frame — but with no position gain it commands nothing; it is
the pose the jaws were in when force mode was entered, clamped to the calibrated
travel, so an advancing reference cannot grow a position term without bound as
it did when the SDK's reference kept moving past a blocked object (a 40 N
setpoint delivered 59 N there).

What is left is open-loop, and that is the price: the jaws can be pushed off the
object by hand, and an empty grasp drives on to the mechanical stop at the
setpoint.  The two guards below still bound it:

* the reference is clamped to the calibrated travel, so even with no object the
  fingers halt at the closed stop;
* the feed-forward is capped by :func:`~litegrip_studio.units.clamp_force_torque`.

A force-mode close therefore cannot exceed its setpoint anywhere in its travel,
including against the hard stop.
