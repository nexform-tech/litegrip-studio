"""The worker: the one thread that touches the backend.

Why one thread
--------------
The SDK is not thread-safe in any sense.  It has no locks, no background control
thread, and every motion method runs its own 200 Hz blocking loop in the caller's
thread over a single socket and a single ``MotorState``.  Two threads driving one
``LiteGrip`` instance therefore interleave frames on the wire.  Rather than
document that and hope, the backend pins itself to the first thread that performs
I/O (:meth:`~litegrip_studio.backend.GripperBackend._claim`) and raises on any
later call from another one — a race becomes an immediate, reproducible failure.

Above that, this class is the only place the backend is called at all.  The GUI
never touches it: it posts commands into :class:`CommandQueue` and receives
``TelemetryFrame`` objects.  That is also why the command path is a queue rather
than a Qt signal — a modal dialog or a slow repaint must not be able to stall the
control loop, and the motor needs a frame every 5 ms for as long as it is enabled.

Draining the queue is the arbitration
-------------------------------------
There is no separate "is a move already in flight" bookkeeping.  A slider drag
emits one command per pixel; between two ticks there may be fifty, and draining
them all in one tick is both correct and pointless — each would rebuild the
trajectory — so :func:`~litegrip_studio.core.commands.coalesce` folds adjacent
runs of the same kind to their last member.  Fifty drag events become one move to
where the operator's finger actually is, for free.

The E-stop is deliberately *not* in the queue.  A command can be queued behind
fifty others; an emergency stop cannot.  It travels on a ``threading.Event`` that
the tick checks before it looks at anything else, and only its release is a
command, because releasing has to be a deliberate act.

Stopping is three different things
----------------------------------
The SDK offers one ``stop()``.  An operator needs three, and conflating them is
how a gripper gets dropped or keeps squeezing:

======  =========================================  ==================
停止     hold the current position, position gain     stays enabled
松力     zero stiffness, zero torque, back-drivable    stays enabled
急停     zero torque then disable, and latch           disabled
======  =========================================  ==================

The latch is what makes the third one different in kind: once tripped, every
motion command is refused until :class:`~litegrip_studio.core.commands.ResetEStop`,
and the reset re-runs the gate first, because releasing the latch on a gripper
with no usable calibration would undo the reason it latched.

Qt-free by design
-----------------
:class:`WorkerLoop` holds the entire loop and takes any object with the signal
attributes as its emitter, so the 200 Hz logic can be driven a tick at a time in
a test with no QApplication, no thread, and no sleeping.  :class:`GripperWorker`
adds the ``QThread`` and the signals and nothing else.

        Every position command in this class is computed *from* a measurement —
        the profile is anchored to it, and a hold freezes it — so a command
        issued before one exists is a command computed from a number the motor
        has not sent.  The SDK's cached angle is 0.0 rad until a status frame
        arrives, and ``to_mm(0.0)`` is somewhere inside the travel: converting it
        produces a plausible-looking millimetre reading of a place the jaws have
        never been.  That is what drove a real gripper to its closed stop on the
        tick 使能 was pressed — the reading converted to −11 mm, the clamp lifted
        it to 0 mm, and the hold then commanded the closed end.

        The test is :attr:`_have_position` — a status frame has arrived since the
        motor was last energised.  Counting frames from the connection instead is
        what broke this.  A disabled drive stops answering while the SDK goes on
        serving the angle from before the disable, and a hand can push the jaws
        anywhere while that number sits still.  The count outlived the disable, so
        the next 使能 took the hold branch with the pre-disable pose and commanded
        it with full position gain — and since the display is drawn from this same
        reading, the operator had been watching that number the whole time they
        were pushing.

        Not the worker's frame count itself, which is still the signal
        :meth:`_link_dead` trusts: that answers "has this link ever spoken", a
        different question, and its answer must not change here.  The gate is
        deliberately pessimistic — the SDK's own ``enable`` polls for a frame
        internally, so one may arrive without this counting it, which costs a
        couple of ticks.  Eroding a claim in the direction of refusing motion is
