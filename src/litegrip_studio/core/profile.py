"""Slew-limited velocity reference generator — the trajectory layer.

Pure: a function of ``(measured, target, v_ref, dt)`` with no clock, no SDK and
no Qt, so it can be fuzzed by the thousand in tests.

Two design decisions carry the weight here.

**The reference is anchored to the measured position every tick.**  The obvious
implementation — integrate an internal reference toward the target and command
that — *winds up*.  When the jaws close on an object the integrator keeps
running to the target, the position error grows, and since the MIT law is
``tau = kp · err + tau_ff`` the commanded torque grows with it.  The gripper
would crush whatever is between the fingers with no force limit.  Anchoring to
measurement makes the error bounded by construction; the speed limit, not the
integrator, decides how fast the jaws approach.

**A trapezoid, not a constant speed.**  Three extra lines buy a continuous
velocity reference at start and stop (no current step, no audible clack), a
stopping-distance term so the jaws decelerate instead of arriving at full speed
and relying on the servo to brake, and a guarantee that the *reference* never
overshoots — so any overshoot is servo lag, bounded by ``kp``.

Contact detection
-----------------
Anchoring the reference is what makes the jaws safe, but it also destroys the
obvious contact signal: the commanded position is ``measured + step`` and nothing
else, so the position error stays tiny whether the jaws are moving or jammed.

The fix is to integrate the *ideal* path separately as :attr:`virtual_mm` — the
position the reference would have reached had nothing been in the way.  It is
never commanded, only compared, so it cannot wind up.  Where the jaws keep up,
``virtual_mm`` and the measurement agree and :attr:`ProfileOutput.lost_mm` stays
near zero; where they are held up, the gap grows at the reference speed.

This is a better contact signal than a torque threshold, which cannot tell a
blocked finger from an accelerating one: the inertial torque at full
acceleration is around 0.6 Nm on this mechanism, several times the friction of
free travel, so any torque threshold low enough to catch a light grip also fires
at the start of every move.

Push at the slow end
--------------------
Anchoring costs push, and the cost is proportional to the speed.  The error the
servo is given is one tick of travel, so the torque behind it is ``kp·v·dt``:
enough to overcome the friction of a stiff mechanism at 150 mm/s and nowhere near
it at 20.  The jaws then stand still, which is the same thing the contact signal
above is looking for, and calling that an obstruction is a report of the
console's own weakness.

:meth:`SpeedProfile.step` therefore takes a ``lead_rad``: while the ideal path is
ahead of the jaws, the command may lead them by up to that much.  It is bounded —
which is what keeps the anchoring guarantee, that the servo's position error is
never larger than the mechanism can safely be asked for — and it is applied only
where a gap has already opened, so it titrates itself to the friction actually in
the way and a mechanism that keeps up never sees it.  Commanding the ideal path
outright would be the unbounded version of the same idea, and would leave every
move running ``kp·lead/kd`` above the speed it was asked for.
