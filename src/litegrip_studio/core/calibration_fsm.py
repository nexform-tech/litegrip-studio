"""The two calibration probes, rewritten as pure state machines.

Both replace an SDK method that cannot be used from a GUI, and in both cases
the reason is the same shape: the SDK's version owns its own loop, and there is
no way into it.

``calibrate_guided`` (gripper.py:520)
    Waits for Enter (``sys.stdin.isatty()`` and ``select``, gripper.py:582), so
    with no terminal it silently degrades to stall-detection only — in a GUI
    there is no terminal at all.  Each step calls ``control_mit_stream`` for a
    fixed 0.3 s, so nothing can interrupt it, and its output goes to ``print``.

``calibrate_manual`` (gripper.py:354)
    Sweeps the axis with the motor for a fixed duration with the position gain
    at zero and takes the extremes it passed through.  It documents "press
    Ctrl+C to stop early", which can never happen here: Python delivers signals
    to the main thread only, so the worker thread would wait out the full
    duration whatever the operator did.  More to the point, an extreme a hand
    happened to sweep past is not a limit anyone measured, and the two points
    are not named — so the result cannot say which end is 0 mm.  The console
    asks for two labelled points instead: see :class:`TwoPointCalibFSM`.

Pure by construction — no backend, no Qt, no clock.  :meth:`tick` is handed the
measured angle and the elapsed time and returns the frame to send, so the whole
probe is a unit test that runs in microseconds and can be driven through a stall
without a gripper.

Two things both probes are careful about:

**Nothing is ever sent with the position gain at zero and the reference left
where it was.**  A motor holds the last MIT frame it was given, so "send
nothing" during a probe means "keep pressing with the last reference" — which at
a hard stop is exactly the command that must not persist.  Every terminal path
returns a zero-gain frame, and the reference is anchored to the measurement
rather than integrated, so a stalled axis cannot wind up.

**A reading is a reading.**  Both probes drop a measurement the mechanism could
not have produced — a value that moved further in one tick than the drive can,
or one outside the SDK's own plausibility bound — rather than folding it into
the result.  The failure this catches is not hypothetical: a dropped frame
leaves the SDK's cached position at ``0.0``, and ``0.0`` is inside any real
travel, so it looks exactly like a limit that was reached.

    calibration files satisfy ``travel = zero - open`` exactly, and one that did

    ``rad_to_mm`` comes from :func:`~litegrip_studio.units.derive_scale`, not

    The reference never integrates.  Each step re-anchors it to

    The axis is limp throughout, which is the reason this probe exists: it is
    the one that still works when the guided probe cannot.  That probe walks the
    jaws into each stop with the motor, so it needs the stops to be reachable
    and detectable; this one needs only a hand and a pair of eyes, and it is
    what an operator falls back on when the mechanism is stiff, the travel is
    not where the SDK expects it, or the drive will not take a probe step at
    all.

    What it asks for is two *labelled* points, in the order a calibration file
    stores them: the open extreme first, then the closed one, which is 0 mm.
    Both labels come from the operator, so nothing has to be declared before the
    probe starts and nothing is assumed: the direction is not checked against an
    answer given beforehand, it *is* the answer, and it is whatever the two
    recorded angles turn out to be.

    Nothing is sampled in the background, so nothing else can be mistaken for a
    limit.  The angle recorded is the one the encoder reports on the tick after
    the button was pressed, which is the first angle taken after the operator's
    hand stopped moving the jaws.  Tracking the extremes the hand passes
    through instead — which is what the SDK's zero-gravity mode does — measures
    the travel that happened to be swept, including wherever the jaws were
    released, and a gripper does not have to be pushed all the way to a stop for
    that to look like a calibration.
