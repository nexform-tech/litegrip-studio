"""The real backend: the LiteGrip SDK behind the same four primitives.

Only public SDK methods are used, and only four of them are on the control path
— ``send_mit_frame``, ``poll``, ``get_state(wait=False)`` and ``stop``.  Every
convenience method is deliberately unused, and the reasons are structural rather
than stylistic (they are listed at length in
:mod:`litegrip_studio.backend`).  The one that matters most here:
``control_mit_stream`` has no abort hook (can_bus.py:342), so anything built on
it cannot be interrupted, which rules out ``open``, ``close``, ``grasp``,
``goto``, ``move_to`` and ``move_at_speed`` for a console whose E-stop has to
work inside one tick.

Two things this class is careful about, both about not lying:

*No blocking getters.*  ``get_position``, ``get_torque``, ``get_error`` and
friends each call ``update_state(timeout_s=0.05)`` internally — 50 ms, ten ticks
— so a status display built on them would stall the control loop.  Everything
comes from one ``get_state(wait=False)``.

*No mm from the SDK.*  ``get_state().position_mm`` is computed by the SDK from
its own ``GripperConfig``.  This class converts the raw rad with the validated
:class:`~litegrip_studio.units.Limits` instead, so the number the FSM reads
back is derived by the same mapping it used to write the command.  Deriving it
twice is how a servo ends up with a steady-state error that does not exist.

The class accepts a pre-built ``gripper`` object, which is how the tests drive
every calibration path without a CAN interface.

        A transport errno is checked first, and deliberately so.  Enable is the

        opens a socket), so a down or bus-off interface surfaces here as

        the operator can act on as written.  It is the more trustworthy of the
