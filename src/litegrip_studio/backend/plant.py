"""A pure model of the gripper's dynamics.

Deliberately has no clock, no ``sleep``, no threads and no Qt: :meth:`Plant.step`
is a pure function of the elapsed ``dt``, so the whole model is deterministic and
testable, and the real-time pacing lives in :mod:`litegrip_studio.backend.sim`.

The model is the DM4310 MIT law the SDK actually commands::

    tau = kp·(q_cmd − q) + kd·(dq_cmd − dq) + tau_ff

followed by a first-order current-loop lag, Coulomb + viscous friction, and
integration.  Hard stops and an optional object between the jaws enter as
*damped springs* added to the dynamics, so the jaws settle a fraction of a
millimetre into whatever they pushed against — which is what a real finger does.

Two modelling choices are load-bearing and were both wrong in a first cut:

*Contact is a spring, not a position clamp.*  Clamping the position makes the
reaction an impulsive constraint force that is unbounded and has nothing to do
with the motor's torque — it produced 4600 N transients.  As a spring, the
equilibrium is self-consistent: the motor's torque IS the grip force.

*The reported torque is the motor's torque alone.*  Adding a separate contact
term to it double-counts the reaction, and the sum was independent of the force
setpoint (every setpoint from 5 N to 999 N reported the same 112.5 N).  The SDK
reads the motor's own torque estimate, so that is what this reports.

The friction and thermal coefficients are tuning choices, not datasheet values.
Their job is to make the simulated gripper behave *plausibly enough to exercise
the UI*: visible tracking lag, force that climbs when blocked, temperature that
responds to sustained effort.  ``tests/test_plant.py`` pins the behaviours that
matter, so if these numbers move the test says why they were chosen.
