"""Backend abstraction: the seam between the control logic and the hardware.

The interface exposes only the *primitives* the motion FSM needs, and never the
SDK's convenience methods.  That is what lets the same FSM, the same profile and
the same gate run against real hardware and against the simulator — so the
simulator exercises the production logic instead of standing beside it.  It is
also what keeps every SDK call inside one thread.

The SDK's own high-level motion methods are deliberately absent.  Each is
unusable here for a concrete reason:

``move_at_speed``
    Ends every call with a fixed 20-frame (~100 ms) hold
    (gripper.py:1117-1121), so slicing it for live feedback stutters.
``goto``/``move_to``/``goto_rad``
    ``duration`` is a settle time, not a speed, so the speed setting cannot be
    honoured.  Also clamps to a config-derived range that is inverted while
    uncalibrated (gripper.py:947).
``open``/``close``/``grasp``
    All funnel into ``control_mit_stream``, which has no abort hook
    (can_bus.py:342), so an E-stop could not interrupt them.
``home``
    Uses the hardcoded ``GripperParams.POS_CLOSED_RAD`` rather than
    ``config.pos_closed_rad`` (gripper.py:781), so it is wrong after
    calibration.
``calibrate_guided``/``calibrate_manual``
    Read stdin / rely on Ctrl+C and print to stdout — unreachable from a worker
    thread.  Reimplemented in :mod:`litegrip_studio.core.calibration_fsm`.

        and it is a property of the frame rather than of its caller.  There are
        two such frames: a probe step, which is looking for the mechanical stops
        the calibration records, and therefore has to be allowed outside the
