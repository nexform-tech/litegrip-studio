"""Calibration provenance, validation, and JSON I/O.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The SDK's ``load_calibration(path)`` reads ``[path, factory_calibration.json]``
in order and returns ``True`` for BOTH, distinguishing them only with a
``log.info`` call (gripper.py:726-749).  A factory file belongs to a nominal
unit, not necessarily to the gripper on the bench, so silently loading it makes
every mm and force reading wrong with nothing on screen to show it.  Worse,
calling nothing at all leaves ``GripperConfig``'s defaults in place —
``pos_closed_rad=0.0`` / ``pos_open_rad=1.14`` — and under those the SDK's own
clamp ``max(open, min(closed, x))`` collapses to a constant, so every target maps
to one angle.

The defence is structural rather than defensive:

1. Read and validate the file ourselves, before asking the SDK for anything.
2. Classify the provenance, and treat "no user file" and "unusable numbers" as
   distinct, separately-handled states.
3. Always hand the SDK an explicit path that we have already confirmed exists,
   so its fallback branch can never fire unnoticed.
4. Cross-check what the SDK actually applied against what we expected, and check
   the calibration against the angle the encoder is reporting.

The last of those is what carries the weight, and it is worth being explicit
about why, because an earlier version of this module leaned on something weaker.
It classified ``zero_position_rad <= max_position_rad`` as the signature of the
uncalibrated defaults and refused it as a problem.  That test does separate the
defaults ``(0.0, 1.14)`` from the real files on this bench — but it separates them
for a reason that has nothing to do with whether they are calibrated: those files
happen to come from grippers whose fingers are assembled so that the encoder angle
*shrinks* as the jaws open.  A file whose two angles were recorded the other way
round has the identical signature and can be perfectly calibrated, and refusing it
made that unit impossible to calibrate at all.  So the ordering is neither a
verdict nor a question put to the operator any more: it is read from the two
angles the calibration was recorded at, and what refuses a calibration is
:func:`~litegrip_studio.units.frame_mismatch`, which compares the file against
the encoder and never looks at the ordering.

Pure layer: no Qt, no SDK at import time, no I/O beyond reading the JSON files
it is pointed at.
