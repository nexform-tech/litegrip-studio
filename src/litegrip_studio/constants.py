# Contact detection for a force-carrying move, in two independent channels.
#
# ``CONTACT_LOST_MM`` is the primary detector and needs no hardware knowledge:
# the trajectory integrates the path it *would* have taken and compares it with
# where the jaws actually are, so a growing gap means something is in the way.
# The threshold is above the worst tracking lag of a free move (about 0.4 mm at
# full acceleration) and small enough to catch contact within 20 ms at speed.
CONTACT_LOST_MM = 1.0

# ``CONTACT_TAU_NM`` is the fast path for a hard object met at low speed, where
# the lost-motion gap accumulates slowly.  It sits above the ~0.6 Nm the
# mechanism draws merely to accelerate itself, which is what stops it firing at
# the start of every move — the reason it is not the primary detector.
CONTACT_TAU_NM = 1.5

# On a *plain* move the lost-motion gap above is a model, and on its own it is
# wrong often enough to matter: it says "the jaws should have come this far by
# now", which assumes the mechanism tracks the reference once the reference is
# at cruise.  One that lags it — friction, a tight linkage, a load, or simply too
# little gain for the speed asked for — accumulates the same millimetre while
# travelling perfectly well.  Measured in simulation against a mechanism drawing
# 0.3 Nm of Coulomb friction, a 20 mm/s move was declared "位置未随时间变化" while
# covering 87% of the distance the trajectory asked for: a stop that is not a
# safety measure but a fault, and the one an operator experiences as the axis
# lurching a couple of millimetres per command instead of going where it was
# sent.  It bites hardest at the slow end of the speed range, which is where a
# careful operator works.
#
# So on a plain move the gap only counts as an obstruction when the jaws are
# also far slower than the trajectory asked them to be.  The comparison is a
# *fraction* of the reference rather than an absolute speed, so a move at
# 5 mm/s is judged as still as one at 150 mm/s and the slow end stays usable.
# A real obstruction is unaffected — the jaws are held against something, so
# their speed collapses against whatever was asked of them — and a jaw that
# creeps into an object instead of stopping dead is left to the stall counter
# and the move deadline, both of which are unchanged and both of which still
# bound the case.
CONTACT_STILL_RATIO = 0.25

# The ratio above settles whether a *moving* jaw is lagging or held.  It cannot
# settle the other half of the same question: a jaw whose speed has collapsed
# because the console never pushed it hard enough looks exactly like one held by
# an object.  That is what the reference being anchored to the measurement costs.
# At cruise the commanded position is ``measured + v·dt``, so the position error
# the servo sees is one tick of travel and the torque behind it is ``kp·v·dt``:
# 0.2 Nm at 20 mm/s, 1.6 Nm at 150, plus ``kd·v``.  A mechanism drawing more
# friction than that does not move at the slow end of the speed range at all, and
# every detector below then reads the standstill it was handed as an obstruction.
# Measured against the plant at 1.0 Nm of Coulomb friction, a 20 mm/s move was
# declared "位置未随时间变化" 2 mm in, having never reached cruise.
#
# So a plain move's command may lead the measured position by this much, on top
# of the tick's own step.  It is a *bounded* lead, which is what keeps the
# anchored reference safe: the squeeze a plain move can apply stays
# ``kp·(CONTACT_LOST_MM + CONTACT_LEAD_RAD·rad_to_mm)/rad_to_mm`` — 25 N on the
# test rig's 46.7 mm/rad, inside the 40 N rating — instead of growing with an
# integrator.
#
# It is also applied *only* while the trajectory's ideal path is ahead of the
# jaws, so it self-titrates: a mechanism that keeps up never sees it, and one
# that does not is given exactly as much extra push as its own friction, no more.
# That is what separates it from simply commanding the ideal path, which would
# leave the axis ``kp·lead/kd`` — 0.2 rad/s, 9 mm/s — above the speed it was
# asked for, on every move, healthy or not.
#
# Sized by measurement, against the plant with Coulomb friction added.  At
# 20 mm/s the lead below unsticks 1.1 Nm — 11 N of drag, a hundred times the
# simulated unit's own free travel, and the case an operator meets as "the axis
# twitches a couple of millimetres per command and reports an obstruction".
# The flip points came out sharp: 0.002 rad covers 0.9 Nm, 0.003 covers 1.0,
# 0.004 covers 1.1.  A real mechanism's friction is not known to 10 %, so the
# margin is deliberate rather than the minimum.
#
# How much it covers is not one number, because only ``kp·lead`` in the push is
# constant: ``kp·v·dt`` and ``kd·v`` both shrink with the speed, so the lead is
# 60 % of the push at the slider's bottom and 13 % of it at the default.  Measured
# over the same plant in 0.05 Nm steps, the friction a move can still shift runs
# from 0.55 Nm at 5 mm/s to 1.1 at 50.  A mechanism stiffer than that at the
# bottom of the range is genuinely beyond the push the drive is given, and the
# console reports it as the stall it is instead of creeping a millimetre at a
# time — which is the honest half of the report this constant answers.
#
# The cost is the blocked-move peak, which rises from 29.6 N with no lead to
# 30.7 N here — still inside the 40 N rating and the bound the test suite
# derives from it.  A stiffer mechanism is *not* reachable by raising this: 1.5
# Nm wants 0.008 rad, whose 34.1 N peak is already over that bound.  The honest
# answer there is more ``kp``/``kd``, not more lead — the ratio of the two is
# what decides it, ``kp·lead`` being the push and ``kd`` what makes the approach
# speed right, so this is a gain question wearing a millimetre's clothing.

#: changes it.  A console that could be told the wrong travel would report every
#: millimetre wrong while looking perfectly healthy, and one that *was* told 10
#: mm (which is what the calibration page's old spinbox did on 2026-09-28)
#: derives a scale below :data:`RAD_TO_MM_MIN`, so the plausibility check turns
#: the whole calibration into a problem and the gate refuses motion — the
#: operator is then holding an unusable console and a file that looks fine.
#: Moving this console to another unit means editing this number and re-probing.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT the SDK's 120 mm.  ``GripperConfig.max_stroke_mm``, the
#: README's spec table and every calibration file the SDK writes are built around
#: 120 mm, but that is the nominal stroke of the unit those files were taken on —
#: it is not a measurement of this one, and it is not even the SDK's own number
#: (its guided probe hardcodes 120.0 while the other two calibrations divide by
#: the configured value).  The bench unit's jaws were measured with calipers at
#: 85 mm across the full travel, and this number decides two things that have to
#: be right for the operator to trust the display: the millimetres per rad the
#: angles are converted with, and the top of the slider.
DEFAULT_TRAVEL_MM = 85.0

#: How far inside the probe's recorded open limit the commanded range ends.
#:
#: The probe finds that limit by pressing into it at 40 N under kp=60, and the

#: so the recorded extreme lies slightly *past* the mechanical end of the travel.
#: Commanding to the recorded extreme would therefore press the stop at the end
#: of every full-open move; commanding to the record inset by this much reaches

# mm/rad, and the same number derived at 10 mm would be 8.0.
#
# The same band is deliberately NOT applied to the mm/rad a file carries.  That
