"""Pure mm ↔ rad conversion, travel limits, and force scaling.

No Qt, no SDK, no I/O — everything here is a function of its arguments, so the
whole module is unit-testable and can be reasoned about by hand.

The conversion formulas are the SDK's (not invented), because getting them
subtly wrong is how a gripper drives into a hard stop:

    mm  = (pos_closed_rad - position_rad) * rad_to_mm      gripper.py:1281
    rad = pos_closed_rad - position_mm / rad_to_mm         gripper.py:925

Both of those hardcode the sign of the mapping, and the SDK has no other form: as
written it can only describe a gripper whose encoder angle *shrinks* as the jaws
open, which is how the units it was written for are assembled.  The console does
not take that on trust either: it reads the sign out of the two recorded angles,
:attr:`Limits.direction`, so a file whose angles came out the other way round is
converted by what it says rather than by what the SDK expects.  The two formulas
above are the case of it where the closed stop is the larger angle.

The other thing the SDK's formulas are fed is ``rad_to_mm``, and that one is not
taken from a file at all.  It is derived from the calibration's angles and the
operator's measured travel — :func:`derive_scale` — because the copy stored in a
calibration file describes the unit the file was written for, which is not always
the unit being driven.

    every file on this machine says 120 mm worth of scale no matter which gripper
    the angles were recorded on — load one and a gripper whose jaws travel 85 mm
    reads 120 mm across them, with the slider covering the middle 70% of a travel
    no operator has ever seen the ends of.  The angles in the file are
    measurements; the scale is a derived quantity, so it is derived here from the

    taken with calipers.

    The recorded extremes span ``travel_mm + inset_mm`` and not ``travel_mm``,

    the linkage gives about a millimetre doing so.  Reading the recorded span as
